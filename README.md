# CitiBike Analysis and Visualization with Tableau
## Overview of Statistical Analysis:
CitiBike provides a sought after bike-sharing service throughout many metropolitan and urban settings and is primarily known for its utility, affordability, and its ease of use.  In addition, both locals and tourists within a city setting benefit from access to CitiBike, an easy and simple method of transportation that immediately meets a need.  Utilizing compiled data by CitiBike regarding its usage in New York City is a good place to start analyzing and visualizing how one of the world's largest cities puts the services provided by CitiBike to good use.  Cities that are a more moderate in size could potentially benfit from a bike sharing service similar (if not identical) to that of the one provided by CitiBike.  In this particular instance, CitiBike data for New York City is being used to explore the viabilty of this bike sharing service in Des Moines, IA.  Here is the [link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/matt.martin3017#!/vizhome/Module15NYCAug_2019CitibikePerformance/NYCCitibikeAug_2019?publish=yes)  for the Tableau story developed to help explore the question, "Would a bike sharing service, such as Citibike, be a worthwhile investment in Des Moines, IA?"  Tableau helps to transform the data provided by CitiBike into vibrant visualizations from which cities interested in a bike sharing service can better project how such a service might perform in a different setting and/or city.      
## Results:
The data provided by CitiBike regarding the usage of its services during August 2019 in New York City, NY has a plethora of records and further detailed descriptions of these records.  Some of the descriptions provided within the data include: start time, end time, starting location, ending location, gender, type of customer, etc. These categories were the ones primarily used when compiling visualizations that show how the services provided by CitiBike could be translated to a smaller scale city.


### NYC CitiBike Peak Bike Use:

Within this dashboard four different visualizations are compiled in an effort to more easily see the peak times of use and how long the bikes are used.  The visualizations include: total number of trips, checkout times for users, trips by weekday per hour and the August peak hours.  There are clear spikes in usage on weekdays (Monday through Friday) for hours before and after work shifts.  In addition, it can be seen that on the weekends bikes are used quite evenly throughout the midday, most likely for casual errands or leisurely activites.  The two story points beyond this first dashboard are single visualzations showing the checkout times for users and the trips by weekday per hour, providing a more enhanced and detailed view of this data for further investigation.    

### NYC CitiBike Use by Gender:

Gender is the primary focus for the next dashboard, drilling down further in detail how bikes are used between customers that identify as  female, male, or unknown.  Visualizations were created to show in greater detail the relationship between gender and bike usage.  There are almost one million more male customers than female customers.  In addition, the bulk of the weekday usage before and after work shifts consist of male customers.  

### NYC CitiBike by Customer Type:

A further detail provided within the data is that there are two types of users, customers and subscribers.   When looking at the customer type visualization, about two million of CitiBike's users are classified as subscribers.  Taking that one step further, the majority of CitiBike's subscribers identify as male.  Using Monday's as an example, there are 179,245 more subscribers utlizing CitiBike's services compared to customers, the majority of use landing before and after work shifts.       

## Summary:

Overall there are a handful of conclusions that can be drawn based off of the data provided by CitiBike regarding its users and use frequency.  The peak times of use are generally before and after midday work shifts.  CitiBike's users that identify as male make up the majority of its customer base.  Subscribers total almost two million of the total of CitiBike's users, most likely there is a strong incentive for users to become subscribers (the bulk of the subscribers most likely use CitiBike's services for their daily commutes).  

When addressing whether or not these visualizations provide enough hard evidence that a bike sharing service like CitiBike's is a viable business investment in Des Moines, IA- it is difficult to speak with a great degree of certainty.  The primary reason for this hinderance in drawing definitive conclusions is due to how vastly different the cities, De Moines and New York City, are when compared to eachother.  An additional visualization that compares the gender demographics of Des Moines and NYC would be helpful in clarifying if the bike use based off of gender can be transcribed to the population make-up of Des Moines, IA.  Another visualization that would be helpful is one that shows in detail the length on average of rides, due to the density of NYC, it is highly likely that rides in Des Moines would be longer on average.
